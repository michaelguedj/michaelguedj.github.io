abstract="As any software, model-checkers are subject to bugs. They can thus report false negatives or validate a model that they should not. Different methods, such as theorem provers or Proof-Carrying Code, have been used to gain more confidence in the results of model-checkers. In this paper, we focus on using a verification condition generator that takes annotated algorithms and ensures their termination and correctness. We study four algorithms (three sequential and one distributed) of state-space construction as a first step towards mechanically-assisted deductive verification of model-checkers.",
